# 🎓 Student Performance EDA & Visualization

This project analyzes student performance data and explores how different lifestyle factors (such as study hours, sleep, diet quality, exercise, stress, etc.) influence GPA.  
It includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualizations, and an interactive dashboard** built with Dash.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned missing values (e.g., GPA ranges converted to numeric).
   - Engineered new features (stress level, study hours category, etc.).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Statistical summaries of GPA and lifestyle factors.
   - Correlation analysis between GPA and habits.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots using Plotly Express.
   - Interactive dashboard with **Dash**.

4. **Dashboard**
   - Interactive dashboard to explore:
     - Diet Quality distribution  
     - Sleep Hours vs GPA  
     - Stress Level vs GPA  
     - Exercise Frequency distribution
